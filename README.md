## Raycasting in Unity

This is a Unity project built upon the free [Simplepoly City Low Poly asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/simplepoly-city-low-poly-assets-58899) that explores the `Raycast`, `RaycastAll()` and `Linecast()` C# Physics functions.

This serves as a demo project to expatiate the article How to Raycast in Unity published on my blog.
