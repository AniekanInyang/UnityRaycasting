## Raycasting in Unity

This is a Unity project built upon the free [Simplepoly City Low Poly asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/simplepoly-city-low-poly-assets-58899) that explores the `Raycast()`, `RaycastAll()`, and `Linecast()` C# Physics functions.

This serves as a demo project for the article, [How to Raycast in Unity](https://aniekan.blog/2023/09/15/how-to-raycast-in-unity), published on my [blog](https://aniekan.blog).
